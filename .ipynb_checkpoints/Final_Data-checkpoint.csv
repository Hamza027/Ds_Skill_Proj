Our Purpose:
Fandom connects people with shared passions and builds communities around them. It offers them space to express their joy and love, whether that’s for superheroes, sports teams, or even small batch whiskeys. At MarketCast, we believe in the power of fandom. It’s as important for brands as it is for action heroes and we do fandom research, data science and analytics better than anyone on the planet. This obsessive focus on fans helps the world’s top creators, media platforms, and sports leagues transform followers into fanatics and investments into impact.
Our Values:
Curiosity Makes Us Tick
Our love of learning manifests in everything we do - from the surveys we field and the datasets we analyze to the technology we develop. Where others pause, we push forward, uncovering hidden meaning and answers. Always learning, always looking for more.

Whether its wowing clients with research or solving everyday challenges, we pause to honor great work and everyone who plays a role in it. We acknowledge and recognize great work and hustle that helps deliver the very best outcomes.

As part of our recruitment process, all successful candidates are subject to a Standard Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check. We therefore require applicants to disclose any previous offences at point of application, as some unspent convictions may mean we are unable to proceed with your application due to the nature of our work in healthcare.
Genomics England operate a blended working model, as we know our people appreciate the flexibility. We expect most people to come into the office 2 times each month as a minimum. However, this will vary according to role and will be agreed with your team leader. For some people this is 1 day a quarter, for others it is several days a week. There is no expectation that staff will return to the office full time unless they want to. The exception would be some of our roles that would require you to be on site full time e.g., lab teams, reception team.
Our teams and squads have, and will continue to, reflect on what works best for them to work together successfully and have the freedom to design working patterns to suit, beyond the minimum. Our office locations at the moment are Cambridge and Farringdon (London) and in Autumn 2022 we are relocating our London office location to Canary Wharf. We will also be expanding our regional offices.
Looking ahead to our move to Canary Wharf, we will be designing our new space with blended working in mind, and with the flexibility to adapt to changing work patterns. During the pandemic we will be following government advice on working from home guidance."

This is an exciting time to join us and help shape the future. It’s an opportunity to be part of something special.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
In Consumer Healthcare we embrace our diverse workforce by creating an inclusive environment that celebrates our unique perspectives, generates curiosity to create unmatched understanding of each other, and promotes fair and equitable outcomes for everyone.
We’re striving to create a climate where we celebrate our diversity in all forms by treating each other with respect, listening to different viewpoints, supporting our communities, and creating a workplace where your authentic self belongs and thrives
Location
Recently we’ve shared some exciting proposals with our colleagues which mark an important moment in our preparations for separation and becoming a new, standalone Consumer Healthcare company.
Our preparations are going well. GSK is on track to separate in mid-2022 and create two incredible new companies, each with the ability to improve the health of millions of patients and consumers worldwide, and both great places to work.
We’ve already confirmed that our new Consumer Healthcare company will be headquartered in the UK and the first step we’re taking is to announce proposals to move our CH business from our current location in GSK House in Brentford when we separate, into a new, CH headquarters in Weybridge. This will be a temporary, but important move in the short term, whilst we take this opportunity to design for the future and create an inspiring, flexible, collaborative workspace that meets the changing needs of our people and our business needs.
Inspired by our new culture and purpose, and with a commitment to our sustainability goals, we plan to build a new campus close by which would be home to our headquarters teams, our UK business, our global Oral Health category, R&D and innovation teams, as well as a state-of-the-art Shopper Science lab.
The current and future success of the New GSK and New CH business is due in large part to the talent that resides in each organization. To ensure stability in the lead up to Separation, individuals who are currently dedicated to either business (New GSK or New CH) will not be able to apply for roles in the other business (including employees in the Global Support Functions and the Corporate Functions) prior to Separation, unless where their role has been placed at risk of redundancy. An exception process is in place, however cases in which exceptions would be made are expected to be rare (e.g. where a new role represents a significant promotion opportunity). You must therefore discuss this with your line manager before submitting an application.
#TechConsumer
As a company driven by our values of Patient focus, Transparency, Respect and Integrity, we know inclusion and diversity are essential for us to be able to succeed. We want all our colleagues to thrive at GSK bringing their unique experiences, ensuring they feel good and to keep growing their careers. As a candidate for a role, we want you to feel the same way.
As an Equal Opportunity Employer, we are open to all talent. In the US, we also adhere to Affirmative Action principles. This ensures that all qualified applicants will receive equal consideration for employment without regard to race/ethnicity, colour, national origin, religion, gender, pregnancy, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, age, disability, genetic information, military service, covered/protected veteran status or any other federal, state or local protected class*(*US only).
We believe in an agile working culture for all our roles. If flexibility is important to you, we encourage you to explore with our hiring team what the opportunities are.
Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you’d like to discuss any adjustments to our process which might help you demonstrate your strengths and capabilities. You can either call us on 0808 234 4391, or send an email ukdiversity.recruitment@gsk.com
As you apply, we will ask you to share some personal information which is entirely voluntary. We want to have an opportunity to consider a diverse pool of qualified candidates and this information will assist us in meeting that objective and in understanding how well we are doing against our inclusion and diversity ambitions. We would really appreciate it if you could take a few moments to complete it. Rest assured, Hiring Managers do not have access to this information and we will treat your information confidentially.

"Data Scientist, Causal Inference",Deliveroo,https://uk.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=4f28b781d13b85e5&fccid=1d79a4290fb70d8e&vjs=3,"At Deliveroo we have an outstanding data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision-making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams - using analysis, experimentation, causal inference and machine learning techniques. We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.

Data Scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a highly active data science community, with guest lecturers, study groups, mentorship programmes, a robust technical review process, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. Data Scientists can equally progress as technical leads (individual contributors) and as people managers.

Our data scientists come from all kinds of backgrounds but have excellence in common. Many are formally trained in data science, many are not. We celebrate difference and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

At Deliveroo we're always experimenting. We have hungry customers, eager riders, and busy restaurants in 12 countries and over 200 cities and giving them what they want and need involves continually testing new ideas. Whether we're working to improve our restaurant recommendations or looking to find a more efficient algorithm for routing our drivers, experimentation helps us make the right decisions for our users.

Experimenting at this scale presents some unique challenges and we're investing heavily in building a world-class platform for designing, deploying, and analysing product experiments. We're looking for experts in statistical inference and estimation to join our growing team of data scientists and help us develop innovative statistical solutions for industrial-scale experimentation.

Some of the problems we're working to solve:

How can we monitor possible interaction effects across our experiments? How can we account for such effects in the analysis of our experiments?
How can we improve our inference techniques to correctly account for the many statistical tests we calculate? Once we have chosen such a correction, how can we account for it at the power calculation stage?
How can statistical methods help us estimate the long-term impact of experiments?
How can we leverage modern statistical algorithms in order to identify any business-relevant heterogeneity of treatment effects?
How can we avoid running afoul the selection bias across the many experiments we run? Can we use shrinkage estimators to get closer to the actual impact of an experiment once rolled out?
How can we use the outcomes of previous experiments to improve our inference for a given experiment?

Responsibilities:

Investigating complex methodological problems and working collaboratively with a small team of experts to establish world-class standards for experimentation.
Leveraging your broad statistical awareness to proactively identify opportunities to add to and improve our existing experimentation methods
Prototyping and amending statistical methods to fit our specific circumstances
Prototyping the code and providing clear communication and written documentation for the engineering team

Qualifications:

PhD in statistics, economics, econometrics, or a relevant field of applied mathematics (equivalent business experience)
Broad statistical awareness, including familiarity with frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and a demonstrated ability for developing innovative experimentation and analysis methods
Familiarity with a scripting language, some proficiency with Python would be an asset

Data Science at Deliveroo

We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits and Diversity
At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space."

You're impact driven and eager to have a real positive impact on the company, product, users and very importantly your colleagues as well
You're commercially minded and can put numbers into business perspective

You have a self-starter mindset; you proactively identify issues and opportunities and tackle them without being told to do so
You're a team player whom your colleagues can rely on
You have solid grounding in SQL and preferably Python
You have experience in conducting large scale A/B experiments
Nice to haves:
You have experience in product or growth analytics, preferably in a fast moving tech company

Department

Energy Market Quantitative Analytics

Position purpose

Conduct analysis across energy commodities over data and associated statistical abstractions to discover and illustrate patterns and or statistical skew, and to produce price forecasts derived from market data.

Main Responsibilities

Primary responsibility is to assist in the generation of trade ideas. The approach for this area will be to deploy an array of statistical/mathematical/machine learning models. These applied to the EDFT data universe produce tradable insights as to the behaviour of markets.
To support this primary function, it will be necessary to leverage our comprehensive data/tech platforms to expand the data universe, constructing new metrics or abstractions over markets.
Similarly, a talent for visualisation and communication of ideas will be critical for success in this area.

Experience required

Education or vocational experience with a highly numerical STEM field, for example statistical modelling, stochastics, data science, time series analytics, physics, engineering etc.
Experience or keenness to learn about the mechanics of energy trading, and the associated drivers of price, positioning, seasonality, and fundamentals.
Talent for achieving extraordinary things.

Technical requirements

While not a nameplate function, the amount of data we deal with requires a high technical proficiency – as such applicants will need to be keen on coding, including running simulations on our grid of compute cores. Python is the analytical language of choice, but we also have a scriptable complex event processor, this is necessary for the sake of event throughput. To extend this, a willingness to use C# is required.
To get the results to the consumers, it is crucial to be good with visualisation. Examples of this can include Plotly, PowerBI, Excel etc.
The successful candidate will need to be able to plainly explain the practical ramifications of findings that may have taken several billion calculations, and a few complex measurement methodologies to produce. Fluency in making complex things work for busy people is imperative.

Person specification

Professional
Forensic attention to detail
Self-aware as to the value of current work vs. overall goal.
Open minded
Commercially minded – everything is a value proposition.
Thrive when working in a high energy environment
Strong collaborator – all team members work in the same framework

We have a strong culture of data-driven decision making across the whole company. And we're great believers in powerful, real-time analytics and empowerment of the wider business.

Autonomy. We believe that people reach their full potential when you can remove all the operational obstacles out of their way and let them run with their ideas. This comes together with a strong sense of ownership for your projects. At Monzo, you will get full access to our data and analytics infrastructure. When you discover something interesting, there is nothing stopping you from exploring and implementing your coolest ideas.

Cutting-edge managed infrastructure. All our data infrastructure lives on the Google Cloud Platform, so you don't need to spend your time configuring or managing clusters, databases, etc. All of our infrastructure is designed so that we can have really high data quality, and spend most of our time using that data to support business decisions.

Automation. We aim to automate as much as we can, so that every person in the team can focus on the things that humans do best. As with all data science work, there's some analysis and reporting, and as much as possible we encourage self-serve access to our data through Looker.

What we're doing here at Monzo excites you!
You're impact driven and eager to have a real positive impact on the company, product, users and very importantly your colleagues as well
You're commercially minded and can put numbers into business perspective

You have a self-starter mindset; you proactively identify issues and opportunities and tackle them without being told to do so
You're a team player whom your colleagues can rely on
You have solid grounding in SQL and preferably Python
You have experience in conducting large scale A/B experiments

You have multiple years of experience in product or growth analytics, preferably in a fast moving tech company

We put together major mergers and acquisitions and resolve business crises - from international take-over bids to financial crime investigations and cases of insolvency. Our teams work on iconic deals with national and global clients as well as operating and investing in businesses, new ventures and entrepreneurs in our local market and communities. It’s both a responsibility and a privilege to guide our clients through moments that matter deeply to them. Our breadth of clients in an ever-changing market means we need to be agile - responding when we need to, in a way that really makes a difference.

We draw upon our deals experience across many industries to support and partner with our clients, to positively impact society and the communities in which we operate. The insight we create, coupled with the innovative tools and methodologies we use to access and evaluate the data that matters, contributes to the success of our clients in all Deals situations. We encourage our clients to think more broadly - connecting their actions today with their successes tomorrow. We help our clients throughout the Deals lifecycle to create lasting value for their businesses.

Each of our key areas within Deals, delivers services to the market individually or together by combining our specialists to provide comprehensive client solutions.
Who are we?
We are the world’s largest and most successful deal analytics and modelling team. Sitting at the heart of PwC’s +$10bn global deals business, we work with the world’s largest investors on their most complex transactions and restructurings.
Our purpose is to support the increasingly sophisticated client demand for advanced data-driven insights to underpin their critical investment decisions. We deliver this with:
A range of products and services that deliver transformational insights to our clients throughout the deal cycle;
Significant investments in cutting edge technologies and platforms
A world class and truly diverse team with a range of data science, technology, commercial, financial and industry backgrounds
For the right candidate, this is an amazing opportunity to build a career in an environment that fosters a creative and entrepreneurial spirit, with the unrivalled security, personal development, client access and investment that PwC brings.
We offer an exciting, continuous development journey to help you become a market leading deals advisor.
PwC operates in 156 countries around the world with over 295,000 employees and revenues of US$45bn.
What you’ll be doing:
Your main area of focus will be Investigative Analytics. Supporting forensic investigations, you may be looking for hidden patterns within banks trading systems, looking for potential evidence of market abuse or incidents of rogue trading or searching for evidence of fraud and abuse within a company’s finance system
As part of this team you will help design and deliver truly game changing analysis and insights to meet a range of business needs. For example:
Using a variety of statistical techniques including machine learning to detect patterns or predict events;
Writing Python / R code to create, tune and validate models;
Optimising code and infrastructure for machine learning performance;
Consulting with clients/stakeholders on business issues, often explaining complex technical concepts to non-technical people;
Creation of novel visualisations and explanations to demonstrate our work;
Researching new products, tools and techniques to assist with advancing our machine learning and data science capability;

Supporting on business development activities to help identify and research opportunities on new/existing clients.

In summary, we've built an amazing team in which we’re confident you’ll have fun, learn loads, build confidence and have some fantastic experiences (personal and professional).
How will you get us interested?
You will be technically-minded, and driven by solving complex problems, and you get a kick out of explaining how you do it. You’ll be working with some excellent analytical brains, but also varying stakeholders for our clients, and for this reason you will know how to explain the technical details to non-technical people.
You will use your technical skills to understand the fraud landscape of a business, analyse their data and use this to provide clear insights and advice to our clients.
Therefore, what we can’t go without is:
Data transformation and modelling (e.g. pandas and scikit-learn in Python);
Data storage and querying (e.g. SQL);
Understanding of common data quality issues and the impact they have on our work;
Data cleansing and manipulation for machine learning (e.g. feature engineering);
Dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g. principal component analysis);
Hyperparameter optimization approaches for a range of models;
Clustering and/or text mining concepts and techniques;
Experience with financial / general ledger data; and
Knowledge of the current data science software platforms such as Azure ML.
The role requires flexibility to travel throughout the UK.

Our team is the first in the world to use autonomous vehicles on public roads using end-to-end deep learning, computer vision and reinforcement learning. Leveraging our multi-national world-class research team we're focusing on using data to learn more intelligent algorithms to bring autonomy for everyone, everywhere. We aim to be the future of self-driving cars, not vehicles that are told how to drive through hand-coded rules and maps, but ones which learn from experience and data.

We are a close knit team of researchers, engineers, scientists and more - some of us are straight out of school, others have worked on bleeding edge problems for some of the biggest tech companies on the planet - but we are all working together to solve autonomous driving.

To reimagine mobility for everyone, everywhere, we need a diverse, brave, intelligent, collaborative, dependable, inclusive and open-minded team that are courageous enough to challenge the status quo.

Join us for a challenge like none other!

Where you'll have an impact

As a Data Scientist in the Experimentation group, you will focus on generating robust, actionable insight that helps our product, data and research teams prioritise their efforts today and identify opportunities for tomorrow.

Rather than purely focusing on optimizing ML performance, Data Scientists focus on using experimental and causal inference methods to generate statistically-robust and highly interpretable findings: this often means using ML methods, but tailored to creating actionable insight. This is a fascinating opportunity to pioneer data science methodologies in a very complex and novel space in AV. This means you will:

Build the frameworks that best synthesise our complex video and simulation data, and use it to facilitate analytics-driven strategy from individual product teams all the way to the company level
Formulate and iterate upon the performance metrics Wayve should focus on, to best measure success in an AV 2.0 world
Combine real world experiment methods with offline causal inference techniques to account for the highly dynamic nature of autonomous driving on the road and help us reach statistical power faster
What you'll bring to Wayve

Essential

Comfortable querying and building large datasets, writing production-level SQL for use in data-transformation pipelines.
Prior experience designing robust real-world experiments (e.g. A/B) and critically evaluating test-statistics
Foundations in the fundamentals behind statistics: testing appropriate distributions, testing the assumptions behind frequentist stats
Proficient in using a statistical scripting language and data science/ML packages (e.g. python such as pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels, SciPy or R such as dplyr, Caret, stats)
Well-versed in summarising, visualising and communicating findings in an accessible and compelling way
Track record of influencing team direction through your findings
A bias towards deriving actionable insight that can be used to drive prioritisation and strategy for others.

Desirable

Track record of promoting statistical rigour and experimental best practices in your prior roles.
Prior experience using causal inference/econometric techniques and bayesian methodologies for hypothesis testing.
Prior experience using large datasets with distributed computing (e.g. spark, hadoop or other map-reduce tech)
Prior experience with PyTorch. Passion to take research ideas to production.
Experience working in a fast-moving tech company or startup.
What we offer you
Attractive compensation with salary and equity
Immersion in a team of world-class researchers, engineers and entrepreneurs
A unique position to shape the future of autonomous driving and to tackle the biggest challenges of our time
Bespoke learning and development opportunities
Relocation support with visa sponsorship
Flexible working hours - we trust you to do your job well, at times that suit you and your team
Private onsite chef, in-house bar, lots of socials, and more!

Wayve is built by people from all walks of life. We believe that it is our differences that make us stronger, and our unique perspectives and backgrounds that allow us to build something different. We are proud to be an equal opportunities workplace, where we don't just embrace diversity but nurture it - so that we all thrive and grow."

As part of our recruitment process, all successful candidates are subject to a Standard Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check. We therefore require applicants to disclose any previous offences at point of application, as some unspent convictions may mean we are unable to proceed with your application due to the nature of our work in healthcare.
Genomics England operate a blended working model, as we know our people appreciate the flexibility. We expect most people to come into the office 2 times each month as a minimum. However, this will vary according to role and will be agreed with your team leader. For some people this is 1 day a quarter, for others it is several days a week. There is no expectation that staff will return to the office full time unless they want to. The exception would be some of our roles that would require you to be on site full time e.g., lab teams, reception team.
Our teams and squads have, and will continue to, reflect on what works best for them to work together successfully and have the freedom to design working patterns to suit, beyond the minimum. Our office locations at the moment are Cambridge and Farringdon (London) and in Autumn 2022 we are relocating our London office location to Canary Wharf. We will also be expanding our regional offices.
Looking ahead to our move to Canary Wharf, we will be designing our new space with blended working in mind, and with the flexibility to adapt to changing work patterns. During the pandemic we will be following government advice on working from home guidance."
